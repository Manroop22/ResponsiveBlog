                My Halloween decorations are staving in the box this vear. To be honest. they didn't make it out of the box last vear either. My Halloween spirit has officially been
bludgeoned to death by teenagers who no longer care and a persistent October fear of the Northern California wildfires. And speaking of Fear, isn't there more than enough of that going around? Maybe all of us can pretend that Halloween isn't even happening this year?
